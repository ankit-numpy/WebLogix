            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2020, Mantra WebLogix started with a simple goal: to make web development more accessible 
                and efficient. Over the years, we've grown into a team of passionate developers and designers, helping 
                businesses of all sizes achieve their digital goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our flagship product, TripContriSplitter (TCS), was born out of a real need during our team's travel 
                experiences. We realized how cumbersome it was to track and settle group expenses, so we built a solution 
                that makes it simple and transparent.
